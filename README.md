# My-Data-Analysis-and-Visualization-Projects
## INTRODUCTION
This is an Excel and Power BI data analysis project on the impact of Virtual Reality on Education in different regions with emphasis on Africa. It highlights the potential to enhance learning experiences across various subjects.
It encompasses data on students' engagement, retention rates, and overall academic performances when VR is integrated in the school curriculum.

## PROBLEM STATEMENT
What is the average per retention rate of each students?
What Field of Study has the highest VR engagement level?
Does the VR instructor proficiency have an effect on the perfrmance level of the students?
Is the interest in VR due subjects being offered?
